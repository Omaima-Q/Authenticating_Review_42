## Authenticating Review :

After finishing your rank03, you are going to get an email from 42 staff for authenticating review.

It means they are going to pick one project from rank03 and rank02 and they will ask some questions about it, or they may ask to explain the project.

You have to be prepared for the review, revise all projects and make sure you understand everything in it.

Make sure also to understand the makefile and all it's targets and commands.
